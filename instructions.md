## Survey

This week we will be practicing React state and controlled forms by making a Typeform-like product. Your completed project should consist of at least 3 questions that need to be answered by users. When the user presses submit, they should see a summary of their answers.

### Context:

You can choose what you'd like your survey to be about. Perhaps you'd like to ask other developers what they think about different technologies, or perhaps you'd like to ask people about their favourite foods or hobbies. It's completely up to you.

Once a user has “submitted” the survey you created they should see a summary. It doesn't actually need to be submitted anywhere - the focus here is to practice using React state and controlling forms.

You don't have to use a lot of components to start with when doing this project, see that as more of a stretch goal…

### Requirements:

- Your survey should consist of at least 3 questions.
- At least one question should use radio buttons.
- At least one question should use a select dropdown.
- There should be a submit button. When pressed your app should hide the input form and show a summary of the user's submissions.

### Your page should be responsive:

- Adapting to the different viewports

### Design

How you design your page is up to you, but take accessibility into account when you are styling your form elements - so inputs should have labels and should be easily readable and usable. We STRONGLY recommend having some kind of design or sketch before starting to code.

Feel free to use other survey tools such as Typeform, Google Forms as inspiration. Or you can check out Dribbble, Behance or Pinterest.
