# Instructions

## ðŸŽ¶ Survey

This week we will be practicing React state and controlled forms by making a Typeform-like product. Your completed project should consist of at least 3 questions that need to be answered by users. When the user presses submit, they should see a summary of their answers.

### Requirements:

- Your survey should consist of at least 3 questions.
- At least one question should use radio buttons.
- At least one question should use a select dropdown.
- There should be a submit button. When pressed your app should hide the input form and show a summary of the user's submissions.

### Your page should be responsive:

- Adapting to the different viewports

## Design

ðŸŽ¶ You should follow the design screenshots as closely as possible. We've provided icons for the play, heart and more info icons when hovering on an album. Use the following for fonts:

- Album title - 14px Helvetica #ffffff
- Artist name - 14px Helvetica #a0a0a0
